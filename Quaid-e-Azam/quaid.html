<center><p>   Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah was a pivotal figure in Pakistan's struggle for independence. Born in 1876 in Karachi, Jinnah was trained as a barrister at Lincoln's Inn in London ยน. He began his political career in the Indian National Congress, advocating for Hindu-Muslim unity and self-government. However, he eventually became disillusioned with the Congress and joined the All-India Muslim League, which he later led to achieve Pakistan's independence in 1947. Jinnah's vision for a separate homeland for Muslims was realized on August 14, 1947, when Pakistan was established. He became the country's first Governor-General, working tirelessly to establish the new nation's government and policies until his death in 1948.</p></center>
